# Cricket-Scorecard-using-MongoDB

A DBMS project which stores ball by ball deliveries data of around 700 IPL matches in unstructured format in MongoDB. On searching for a match using the search fields, a Scorecard is generated which has batting and bowling statistics of both the innings of the match by retrieving the data from the DB and performing aggregation on the fetched records. The interface was developed using PyQt and a python connector was used to connect to MongoDB.
